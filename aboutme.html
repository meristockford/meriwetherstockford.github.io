    <P align="center"> I was born in Pennsylvania at a breeding farm where a bunch of other thoroughbreds were raised to race on the track. My dam's (mom) name was Valkyrie and my sire's (dad) name was Storm Center, hence why my name is <i>"Valkin Storm"</i>. A man named Raphael Kissoon purchased me when I was two from the breeding farm and trained me alongside jockey, Samuel Bermudez. I ran four races in my career as a race horse, finishing only two, in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMQHkQFBTkM">first</a> and second, in the races I ran.

    <p> My racing career ended abruptly when I cracked my fetlock bone. This injury would be equivalent to breaking the ankle on human. I had major surgery to repair my fetlock and this involved screwing a screw through the ball of the bone to be able to still have full movement in that leg in my day to day life. After that injury, I was rescued by Turning for Home, a thoroughbred racehorse rescue program, where I was able to recover from such a severe injury.</p>

    <p>After spending two years at the rescue, I was purchased by an older woman from Vermont who used me for trail riding. At this time, I was five and very spunky so the lady passed me on to a teenager who helped train me the basics of a sport called eventing, which is what I do today!</p>

    <p>As you can see in this photo, my leg is all bandaged up from the injury that I had on the track.</p>
