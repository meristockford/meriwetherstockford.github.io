    <p align="center"> I was purchased by Meri, my current owner in 2016 down in South Carolina. I was working with a girl named Sam down there and they were working to sell me to someone who would compete me to higher levels and give me a job. Meri bought me home April 3rd of 2016 and it was love from there on.</p>

 <p> We have done a few shows together and we are continuing to learn from each other. I am so glad to have found a forever home. <p/>
